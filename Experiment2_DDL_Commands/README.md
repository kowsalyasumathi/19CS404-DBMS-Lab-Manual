# Experiment 2: DDL Commands

## AIM
To study and implement DDL commands and different types of constraints.

## THEORY

### 1. CREATE
Used to create a new relation (table).

*Syntax:*
sql
CREATE TABLE (
  field_1 data_type(size),
  field_2 data_type(size),
  ...
);

### 2. ALTER
Used to add, modify, drop, or rename fields in an existing relation.
(a) ADD
sql
ALTER TABLE std ADD (Address CHAR(10));

(b) MODIFY
sql
ALTER TABLE relation_name MODIFY (field_1 new_data_type(size));

(c) DROP
sql
ALTER TABLE relation_name DROP COLUMN field_name;

(d) RENAME
sql
ALTER TABLE relation_name RENAME COLUMN old_field_name TO new_field_name;

### 3. DROP TABLE
Used to permanently delete the structure and data of a table.
sql
DROP TABLE relation_name;

### 4. RENAME
Used to rename an existing database object.
sql
RENAME TABLE old_relation_name TO new_relation_name;

### CONSTRAINTS
Constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted by the constraint. It can be specified when the table is created (using CREATE TABLE) or after it is created (using ALTER TABLE).
### 1. NOT NULL
When a column is defined as NOT NULL, it becomes mandatory to enter a value in that column.
Syntax:
sql
CREATE TABLE Table_Name (
  column_name data_type(size) NOT NULL
);

### 2. UNIQUE
Ensures that values in a column are unique.
Syntax:
sql
CREATE TABLE Table_Name (
  column_name data_type(size) UNIQUE
);

### 3. CHECK
Specifies a condition that each row must satisfy.
Syntax:
sql
CREATE TABLE Table_Name (
  column_name data_type(size) CHECK (logical_expression)
);

### 4. PRIMARY KEY
Used to uniquely identify each record in a table.
Properties:
Must contain unique values.
Cannot be null.
Should contain minimal fields.
Syntax:
sql
CREATE TABLE Table_Name (
  column_name data_type(size) PRIMARY KEY
);

### 5. FOREIGN KEY
Used to reference the primary key of another table.
Syntax:
sql
CREATE TABLE Table_Name (
  column_name data_type(size),
  FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES other_table(column)
);

### 6. DEFAULT
Used to insert a default value into a column if no value is specified.

Syntax:
sql
CREATE TABLE Table_Name (
  col_name1 data_type,
  col_name2 data_type,
  col_name3 data_type DEFAULT 'default_value'
);


*Question 1*
--
Create a table named Shipments with the following constraints:
ShipmentID as INTEGER should be the primary key.
ShipmentDate as DATE.
SupplierID as INTEGER should be a foreign key referencing Suppliers(SupplierID).
OrderID as INTEGER should be a foreign key referencing Orders(OrderID).
For example:

Test
INSERT INTO Shipments (ShipmentID, ShipmentDate, SupplierID, OrderID) VALUES (2, '2024-08-03', 99, 1);
Result:
Error: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed
```
SQL CODE
create table Shipments(
ShipmentID  INTEGER  primary key,
ShipmentDate  DATE,
SupplierID  INTEGER,
OrderID INTEGER,
foreign key (SupplierID) references Suppliers(SupplierID),
foreign key (OrderID) references Orders(OrderID));
```

*Output:*

*Question 2*
---
In the Books table, insert a record where some fields are NULL, another record where all fields are filled without any NULL values, and a third record where some fields are filled, and others are left as NULL.

ISBN             Title                      Author           Publisher   Year

sql
SQL CODE
INSERT INTO Books (ISBN,Title,Author)
VALUES('978-1234567890','Introduction to AI','John Doe'); 
INSERT INTO Books (ISBN,Title,Author,Publisher,Year)
VALUES('978-9876543210','Deep Learning','Jane Doe','TechPress','2022');

*Question 3*
---
Create a new table named item with the following specifications and constraints:

1.item_id as TEXT and as primary key.
2.item_desc as TEXT.
3.rate as INTEGER.
4.icom_id as TEXT with a length of 4.
5.icom_id is a foreign key referencing com_id in the company table.
6.The foreign key should cascade updates and deletes.
7.item_desc and rate should not accept NULL.


sql
SQL CODE
CREATE TABLE item(
item_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
item_desc TEXT NOT NULL,
rate INTEGER NOT NULL,
icom_id TEXT CHECK(length(icom_id)=4),
FOREIGN KEY (icom_id) REFERENCES company(com_id)
ON UPDATE CASCADE
ON DELETE CASCADE
);
